## *`_printf`*

Is a modified version of one of the main output C programming function `printf()`.

# Description

The `_printf`, as part of a Holberton project, seeks to recreate the `printf()` function
in all aspects. From receiving a number of arguments in a string inside quotations, until
sending a formatted output to the screen.

# Requirements

Prototype: `int _print(const char *format, ...)`

Allowed editors: `vim`

All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

Code will be compiled this way: `$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c`

The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `main.h`
